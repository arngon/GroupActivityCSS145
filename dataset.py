st.subheader("Conclusion")
st.markdown("The analysis of the laptop market reveals some interesting trends and consumer preferences. The scatter plot shows that most laptops are priced between €700 and €2000, which indicates that buyers are willing to spend on quality devices. People also seem to prefer lightweight laptops, with weights ranging from 1.15 kg to 2.5 kg, making them easy to carry around. The pie chart highlights that popular models like the Aspire 3, EliteBook 840, and Latitude 5580 sell about 12 units on average, while the Dell XPS 13 is a standout, racking up around 30 sales. The bar graph shows that Ultrabooks and Gaming Laptops average around 200 units sold, but Notebook laptops are the clear favorites, with about 700 sales, suggesting consumers are leaning toward versatile and budget-friendly options. Looking at the data further, the histogram indicates that most laptops weigh between 1.25 kg and 2.75 kg, which balances portability and performance well. The line chart reveals that many laptops come with 8 GB to 16 GB of RAM, showing that people are prioritizing performance for tasks like multitasking. The candlestick chart shows that 13 out of 19 brands offer laptops priced between €700 and €2100, pointing to a competitive market. The bubble chart graph shows that most laptops are set to have around 2.0 - 3.0 GHz CPUs, and can cost as much as €6000, But €2000- €4000 can be beat the €6000 one in someaspects. The tree map illustrates which brands are in demand, with Lenovo, HP, Asus, and Dell taking up the most space, likely because of their wide range of models. The Violin plot depicts that most laptops are priced around €1000-€2000, and tops out at around €8000 from Razer. Finally, the word cloud highlights popular models and specifications, like Inspiron, Latitude, and common configurations of 4GB, 8GB, and 1TB. Overall, the data suggests that both budget-friendly and high-performance laptops have a strong market presence, with brands that focus on quality and value likely to do well.")
